# Titanic
Notebook from Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster". shows an approach for prediction of survival of a person on the Titanic. It gives a comparison of Neural Network (NN) using Sequential Model from Keras API for TensorFlow and Random Forest Classifier (RF) from scikit-learn.

Further, I will be using Hyperparameter Opimization technique, Grid Search for the NN model and Random Search for RF model.
